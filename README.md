This game is often a four player where the players are split into two teams. These teams compete to guess their words first.

### Setup
- A 4x5 "board" of cards is laid down for all players to see.
- Each team nominates a codegiver and a guesser.
- The codegiver for each team is given a seperate board which shows them which card is their team's, which are the other team's, which are neither teams, and finally the one card that results in immediate loss.
- The team that goes first will have one more card than the other team.
